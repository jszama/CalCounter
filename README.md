# CalCounter - Your Personal Calorie Tracker

CalCounter is a user-friendly calorie-tracking application crafted using WPF and C#. Tailored for personal use, this app empowers users to monitor and manage their daily calorie intake effectively.

## Key Features:
#### 1) User Registration and Login:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamlessly register and log in to the app to personalize your calorie-tracking experience.
&nbsp;
#### 2) Daily Calorie Entry:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log your daily calorie intake with ease, providing a comprehensive snapshot of your nutritional habits.
&nbsp;
#### 3) Personal Monitoring:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain insights into your weekly and monthly intake averages, facilitating a better understanding of your dietary patterns.
&nbsp;
#### 4) Social Interaction:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect with friends within the app and view their profile pages to foster a sense of community around healthy living.
&nbsp;
#### 5) Privacy Settings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tailor your privacy settings to control the visibility of your profile. For users with public profiles, monthly and weekly average intake, username, profile picture, and bio are displayed.
&nbsp;
#### 6) Local Database*:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All user details and calorie intakes are securely stored within a local database, ensuring data integrity and quick access.

###### *If I were to upscale the app, there are plans to migrate to a cloud database solution, such as AWS. This strategic move ensures scalability, reliability, and enhanced data security.
