# CalCounter.
Calorie tracking application made using WPF C#, the app allows a user to register and log into the app where the user may enter their calorie intake daily.
The app was designed for my personal use, allowing me to monitor my calorie intake and see my weekly and monthly intake averages.
Within the app, the user may also check the profile pages of other users which they are friends with. If the friends have their privacy set to public, their monthly and weekly average intake will be displayed,
alongside their username, profile picture, and bio.

The application stores all user details and calorie intakes within a local database. This would be changed if upscaling the project, a cloud database would be used such as AWS.
